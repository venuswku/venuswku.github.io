                    It's amusing how this flight attendant managed to make safety instructions entertaining, so I thought it'd be fun to share this through text animation.
                    Since he speeds through the safety instructions, I hope this also helps people who couldn't hear him clearly.

                    The unique variety of eerie sound effects mixed into the song's instrumentals inspired me to represent the music in an abstract way. <span role="img" aria-label="music-note">ðŸŽµ</span>
                    <br/>It was challenging to omit the use of symbolism, but I think using abstract shapes and patterns really enhanced the song's composition.
